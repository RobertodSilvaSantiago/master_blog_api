# master_blog_api2

 Flask application that serves as a simple REST API for managing blog posts. Here's an overview of what the code does:

It imports necessary modules and libraries, including Flask, Flask-CORS, logging, and exceptions from Werkzeug.

The Flask application is created, and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is enabled to allow requests from different domains.

The code defines a list of POSTS that represents the blog posts. Each post is a dictionary with an id, title, and content.

Several routes are defined using the @app.route decorator:

The /api/posts route handles GET requests and provides a list of posts. It supports optional query parameters sort and direction for sorting the posts.
The /api/posts route also handles POST requests for adding new posts. The request body must contain JSON data with title and content keys.
The /api/posts/<post_id> route handles DELETE requests for deleting a post with the given post_id.
The /api/posts/<post_id> route handles PUT requests for updating a post with the given post_id. The request body must contain JSON data with the fields to be updated.
The /api/posts/search route handles GET requests and allows searching for posts by title and/or content. It supports query parameters title and content.
There are several helper functions:

search_posts_by_word_in_title searches for posts where the title contains a specific word.
search_posts_by_word_in_content searches for posts where the content contains a specific word.
get_data_to_update extracts the valid fields from the JSON data for updating a post.
get_post_by_id retrieves a post by its post_id.
get_unique_id_for_post generates a unique ID for a new post based on the existing posts.
get_validated_json attempts to decode the JSON data from the request and returns it if successful, or None if there was an error.
Finally, the Flask application is run on the host "0.0.0.0" and port 5002 in debug mode.

In summary, this code provides endpoints for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting blog posts, as well as searching for posts by title and/or content.
